                    <p><b>Shannon Cooper</b> <i>August 21, 2020</i> </p>

                    <p>This is one my favorite movies of all time!  <em>The Last of the Mohicans</em> encompasses all the things I love in historical films from action to suspense to drama and a little romance all in the backdrop of graphic fighting scenes that almost feel like you're there in the movie.  Each scene was masterfully shot as it displayed breathtaking imagery and powerful backdrops.  
                        
                    The acting had its highs and lows, but the musical score was really the hightlight of this movie.  Every song and note invoked the emotions the director, Michael Mann, wanted to portray on the screen.  I could feel major milestone, every excitement, and every pain as the music played amidst the movie and it really brought the whole film together for me.

                    If you appreciate a good script, pretty decent acting, historical details, and a little bit of romance, <em>The Last of the Mohicans</em> is the movie to watch even after all these years!</p>
