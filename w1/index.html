    <p>What can I say about Shannon Cooper?  She is <b>smart</b>, <u>funny</u>and just a little bit <i>sassy.</i>
    Shannon enjoyes movies, reading, writing, and literally just having a great time.  Shannon is a major work horse working well over 50 hours every week, but she still makes time for college and taking care of her elderly mother who is currently in remission with stage three lung cancer.
